title: IPTV is the Answer
---
I have a 50Mbps internet connection provided by PLDT that I am paying PHP 3500 monthly for. It's their *POWER PLUS PLAN 3500* offer that comes with a 2-year lock-in. It's internet + cable TV bundle, similar to the one I had before with SkyCable. I was very disappointed to learn though that Cignal's set-top box is an additional PHP 199 on top of your bill - this is after I had everything installed. So I held with my frustration and did not avail the STB and I'm stuck with paying full price even if I don't avail Cignal. I look silly especially now that they also offer the same 50Mbps sub without Cignal for PHP 2899. This experience made me more desperate to look for alternatives. I have decided to [cut the cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord-cutting) (that I never had in the first place) and start consuming everything via the internet.

I first bought a [digital TV box from RCA](http://sci.com.ph/digitaltvbox/) which lets me watch free-to-air (FTA) channels. As you may know, [ABS-CBN TVplus](http://tvplus.abs-cbn.com/) has exclusive channels (DZMM Teleradyo, CINEMO, YEY, and KNOWLEDGE Channel) which I won't be able to watch with this device, but I'm all for openness so I skipped that and went with a generic tuner. Maintaining 2 remotes is a big hassle, so I don't use it often - good thing [ABS-CBN](http://www.iwantv.com.ph/), [GMA](https://www.youtube.com/c/gmanetwork/videos), and [TV5](http://www.tv5.com.ph/) has live streams - they're only SD though. [DZMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LQ8UXpC7CE) has it too (audio only) if you think you're missing DZMM Teleradyo from TVplus. Check this [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/live/featured) for a list of other local streams.

Ok, TV is antiquated, we all know that. The world has moved on to video on demand (VOD) like Netflix. But before jumping into the *Netflix and chill* bandwagon, make sure (1) you will be able to meet its [connection speed requirements](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306) and (2) has a device you can use with the service. Also, because of [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management), Netflix may or may not stream HD or Ultra HD content to you even if it is available. This is not the case with other VOD services available locally like [iflix](https://www.iflix.com/) and [HOOQ](https://www.hooq.tv/ph) so you may want to check those first. As for me, fortunately I have a [Sony X8300C 4K Android TV](http://www.sony.com.ph/electronics/televisions/x8300c-series) that is able to do any of these.

With FTA, free live streams and a VOD sub, I have access to (almost) everything a cable TV sub can offer plus a lot more. 99.9% of people can live with this (I am part of the greedy 0.1%). I have more to share about these things on other posts. But the reason why I wrote this is because of IPTV. This tech is nothing new, and I just discovered it and am still on the iceberg's tip.

Somebody in a forum offered me an IPTV sub. The company, named Sudbury Streams, offers a huge list of TV channels - US, UK, Filipino, etc. - for only CAD 15 a month (PHP 541.45). This is basically cable TV in steroids.
